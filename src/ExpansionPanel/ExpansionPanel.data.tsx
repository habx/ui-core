    This book is largely concerned with Hobbits, and from its pages a reader may
    discover much of their character and a little of their history. Further
    information will also be found in the selection from the Red Book of
    Westmarch that has already been published, under the title of The Hobbit.
    That story was derived from the earlier chapters of the Red Book, composed
    by Bilbo himself, the first Hobbit to become famous in the world at large,
    and called by him There and Back Again, since they told of his journey into
    the East and his return: an adventure which later involved all the Hobbits
    in the great events of that Age that are here related.
